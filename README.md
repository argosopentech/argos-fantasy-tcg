Argos Fantasy TCG is a trading card game available in the public domain that is designed to be compatible with the MTG game. All of the cards are based on, and have equivalent abilities, to real MTG cards in the [Legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_formats#Legacy) format. All copyrighted material material from the the original cards has been removed so these cards can be freely redistributed and printed allowing anyone to play regardless of financial ability. [Game rules and mechanics are not covered by copyright law](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2014-15/march-april/its_how_you_play_game_why_videogame_rules_are_not_expression_protected_copyright_law/) so these cards are allowed to have identical functional abilities to the cards they are based on. The art has been replaced with art that was already available in the public domain in the United States (and most other countries), and the description of the abilities has been rewritten (although the function remains the same). For card names such as "Hail of Arrows" that simply consist of dictionary words the name's from the original MTG cards is used since [short phrases aren't protected by copyright in the U.S.](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html), however, when the card name is a based on a name of a potentially copyrighted character in the MTG universe like "Serra Angel" then the name is changed to a generic name like "Attacking Angel" even though the function is maintained.
